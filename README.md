# Enterprise AI Governance Portfolio

Enterprise AI strategy and responsible AI case studies demonstrating structured lifecycle oversight and scalable implementation within regulated environments.

This portfolio reflects applied AI initiatives with emphasis on:

- AI lifecycle governance  
- Bias detection and fairness assessment  
- Deployment readiness and risk mitigation  
- Cloud-based scalable implementation  
- Human-in-the-loop oversight  
- Cross-functional stakeholder alignment  

The focus is on enabling responsible, explainable, and business-aligned AI adoption across enterprise systems — including workforce-facing platforms such as HR technology environments.
