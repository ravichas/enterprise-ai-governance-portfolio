# AI Governance Framework

This folder contains the Enterprise AI Governance & Lifecycle Oversight Framework used to guide responsible AI implementation across enterprise environments.

## What This Framework Covers

- AI use case qualification and risk classification  
- Data governance and bias assessment  
- Model validation and performance transparency  
- Deployment readiness controls  
- Continuous monitoring and drift detection  
- Workforce and ethical impact considerations
