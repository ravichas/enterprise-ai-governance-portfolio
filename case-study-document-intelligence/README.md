# Case Study: AI-Powered Document Intelligence & Workflow Automation

## Overview

This case study highlights the design and deployment of an AI-driven document intelligence system built to support large-scale review workflows in a regulated enterprise environment.

The system leveraged AWS infrastructure and LLM-enhanced processing to automate insights extraction, summarization, and reviewer assignment across unstructured documents (RFIs, proposals, review materials).

## Business Challenge

Manual document review processes were:

- Time-intensive and repetitive  
- Difficult to scale across large review volumes  
- Dependent on manual summarization and reviewer routing  
- Prone to duplication and inconsistency  

There was a need for a scalable, responsible AI-enabled solution to improve workflow efficiency while maintaining governance controls.

---

## Solution Architecture

The solution included:

- AWS-based document ingestion pipelines  
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for structured insight extraction  
- LLM-based summarization and contextual analysis  
- Reviewer assignment automation logic  
- Duplication detection mechanisms  
- Evaluation checkpoints for output quality  

The system was designed with governance oversight, ensuring outputs were reviewed and validated prior to operational use.

## Enterprise Impact

- Improved review efficiency by approximately 40%  
- Reduced manual summarization effort by approximately 70%  
- Increased consistency in reviewer assignment  
- Enhanced workflow transparency and traceability

## Governance & Responsible AI Considerations

Special attention was given to:

- Output reliability and hallucination risk mitigation  
- Human-in-the-loop validation processes  
- Documentation of model assumptions and limitations  
- Bias monitoring in automated reviewer routing logic  
- Clear delineation between decision-support and automated decision-making

## Enterprise Relevance to HR Technology

This implementation demonstrates how AI can:

- Enhance knowledge workflows  
- Support document-driven decision processes  
- Improve efficiency while maintaining oversight  
- Integrate responsibly into high-impact operational systems  

The same principles apply to HR AI use cases such as resume screening, internal knowledge assistants, policy Q&A automation, and workforce analytics systems.
