# Case Study: AI-Powered Document Intelligence & Workflow Automation

## Overview

This case study illustrates the design and implementation of an AI-enabled document intelligence system supporting large-scale review workflows within a regulated enterprise environment.

The initiative leveraged AWS infrastructure and LLM-enhanced processing to automate insight extraction, structured summarization, and reviewer routing across unstructured documents (RFIs, proposals, and technical review materials).

## Business Challenge

Manual review workflows were:

- Time-intensive and difficult to scale  
- Dependent on repetitive summarization and manual reviewer assignment  
- Vulnerable to duplication and inconsistency  
- Limited in transparency across decision pathways  

A scalable, governance-aware solution was required to improve operational efficiency without compromising oversight or reliability.

---

## Solution Design

The implemented solution incorporated:

- Cloud-based document ingestion and preprocessing pipelines (AWS)  
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for structured signal extraction  
- LLM-driven summarization with validation checkpoints  
- Automated reviewer assignment logic with duplication detection  
- Structured evaluation metrics for output consistency and reliability  

Governance controls were embedded directly into workflow design, ensuring outputs were reviewed, validated, and traceable prior to operational use.

## Measurable Impact

- ~40% improvement in review efficiency  
- ~70% reduction in manual summarization effort  
- Increased consistency and transparency in reviewer routing  
- Improved traceability across document review decisions  

---

## Governance & Responsible AI Controls

Key safeguards included:

- Output reliability monitoring and hallucination risk mitigation  
- Human-in-the-loop validation for high-impact decisions  
- Clear documentation of assumptions and system limitations  
- Bias awareness in automated reviewer assignment  
- Explicit separation of decision-support functions from autonomous decisions  

This ensured the system augmented — rather than replaced — human judgment.

## Enterprise Transferability to HR Technology

The principles demonstrated in this implementation directly translate to workforce-facing AI systems, including:

- Resume and application screening workflows  
- Internal knowledge assistants  
- Policy and compliance document automation  
- Workforce analytics and decision-support systems  

The emphasis on fairness, oversight, traceability, and human accountability is particularly critical in HR environments where employee trust and transparency are essential.
